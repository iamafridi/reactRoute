# React Route
This is just a practice session on react route, created a page dynamically and I took help from jsonPlaceHolder for API from where i took user and posts data.

# Features
*There are Home,User,Post,About and contact us section, everytime you navigate your selected path gets active because I have used useNavigation and You can go deeper when you click Show More button on each post section.
* there are some minor transition such as when your page takes time to load it will show a message, If you go to one path to another you will not get any delay ,it will smooth as ever.

  # Thank you and have a nice day














This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
